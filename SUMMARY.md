**TimberSeg 1.0** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the forestry and robotics industries. 

The dataset consists of 440 images with 10735 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wood*).

Images in the TimberSeg dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *original* (220 images) and *prescaled* (220 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Northern Robotics Laboratory, Universite Laval, Canada</span>.
